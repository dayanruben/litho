 * Creates a [Style] which will apply the given [RenderUnit.Binder] to the [View] rendered by the

 * can apply some property generically to any type of Component.
 *
 * The usage of this binder will guarantee that there will be an associated View to it by calling
 * [Style.wrapInView].
 *
 * Notes for implementing a [RenderUnit.Binder]:
 *
 * The binder's [RenderUnit.Binder.bind] will be called by the framework with the current model to
 * bind the model to the View content, and [RenderUnit.Binder.unbind] will be called with the
 * current model to unbind the model from the View content. When the model changes in a new render
 * pass, [RenderUnit.Binder.shouldUpdate] will be called with the old and new models before
 * unbind/bind: if it returns true, unbind(oldModel)+bind(newModel) will be called. Otherwise, the
 * update will be skipped.
 *
 * In some cases, you may want your binder's bind to be called only the first time the content is
 * mounted, and unbind called the last time it is unmounted before going offscreen. In that case,
 * you can unconditionally return false from [RenderUnit.Binder.shouldUpdate].
 *
 * Generally speaking, a [RenderUnit.Binder] should be static and unchanging, while the model may
 * change between renders.
